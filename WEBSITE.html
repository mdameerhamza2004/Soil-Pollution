                    <p>“Soil pollution” refers to the presence of a chemical or substance out of place and/
                        or present at a higher than normal concentration that has adverse effects on 
                        any non-targeted organism (FAO and ITPS, 2015). Although the majority of pollutants 
                        have anthropogenic origins, some contaminants can occur naturally in soils as 
                        components of minerals and can be toxic at high concentrations. Soil pollution 
                        often cannot be directly assessed or visually perceived, making it a hidden danger.
                        The diversity of contaminants is constantly evolving due to agrochemical and 
                        industrial developments. This diversity, and the transformation of organic 
                        compounds in soils by biological activity into diverse metabolites, make soil 
                        surveys to identify the contaminants both difficult and expensive. The effects of 
                        soil contamination also depend on soil properties since these control the mobility, 
                        bioavailability, and residence time of contaminants (FAO and ITPS, 2015).
                        Industrialization, wars, mining and intensification in agriculture have left a legacy 
                        of contaminated soils around the world (Bundschuh et al., 2012; DEA, 2010; EEA, 2014; Luo et 
                        al., 2009; SSR, 2010). Since urban expansion, soil has been used as a sink for dumping 
                        solid and liquid wastes. It was considered that once buried and out of sight, the 
                        contaminants would not pose any risk to human health or the environment and that 
                        they would somehow disappear (Swartjes, 2011). The main sources of soil pollution 
                        are anthropogenic, resulting in the accumulation of contaminants in soils that may 
                        reach levels of concern (Cachada, Rocha-Santos and Duarte, 2018).
                        Soil pollution is an alarming issue. It has been identified as the third most 
                        important threat to soil functions in Europe and Eurasia, fourth in North Africa, 
                        fifth in Asia, seventh in the Northwest Pacific, eighth in North America, and ninth 
                        in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America (FAO and ITPS, 2015). The presence of certain 
                        pollutants may also produce nutrient imbalances and soil acidification, two major 
                        issues in many parts of the world, as identified in the Status of the World’s Soil 
                        Resources Report (FAO and ITPS, 2015).
                        The unique global estimate of soil pollution was done in the 1990s by the 
                        International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) and the United 
                        Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which estimated that 22 million hectares 
                        had been affected by soil pollution (Oldeman, 1991). Latest data, however, indicate that 
                        this number may underestimate the nature and extent of the problem. National 
                        attempts to estimate the extent of soil pollution have been undertaken mainly in 
                        developed countries. According to the Chinese Environmental Protection Ministry, 
                        16 percent of all Chinese soils and 19 percent of its agricultural soils are categorized 
                        as polluted (CCICED, 2015). There are also approximately 3 million potentially polluted 
                        sites in the European Economic Area and cooperating countries in the West 
                        Balkans (EEA-39) (EEA, 2014) and more than 1 300 polluted or contaminated sites 
                        in the United States of America (USA) are included on the Superfund National 
                        Priorities List (US EPA, 2013). The total number of contaminated sites is estimated 
                        at 80 000 across Australia (DECA, 2010). While these numbers are informative in 
                        helping us understand the effects of certain activities on soils, they do not reflect 
                        the complete extent of soil pollution around the world, and they highlight the inadequacy of available information and the differences in registering polluted sites 
                        across geographic regions (Panagiotakis and Dermatas, 2015). In low- and middle-income 
                        countries, the lack of data and information makes one of the world’s biggest global 
                        problems invisible to the international community. With this overview, it is evident 
                        that there is an urgent need to implement a global assessment of soil pollution.
                        Fortunately, awareness on the importance of soil pollution is increasing around 
                        the world, leading to an increase in research conducted on the assessment and

                <p>The term “soil contamination” has frequently been used as a synonym for soil 
                    pollution. The Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS) under the 
                    Global Soil Partnership (GSP) has formalized definitions of the two terms (FAO 
                    and ITPS, 2015). Soil contamination occurs when the concentration of a chemical or 
                    substance is higher than would occur naturally but is not necessarily causing harm. 
                    Soil pollution, on the other hand, refers to the presence of a chemical or substance 
                    out of place and/or present at a higher than normal concentration that has adverse 
                    effects on any non-targeted organism.
                    One issue is the difficulty in establishing a definition of “normal concentrations.” 
                    It can be easier to establish hazardous concentrations for human-made substances 
                    that do not naturally occur in soils, but it can be challenging to do the same for 
                    heavy metals and metalloids, which can originate from the weathering of rocks 
                    and minerals. In that case, the parent material, climate and weathering rate need to 
                    be taken into consideration before establishing thresholds. Additionally, land use 
                    and management practices can affect background levels of substances occurring 
                    in soils. When referring to recommended levels, there are also many differences 
                    from country to country and among regions, not only about the value itself, but 
                    also about the name used to define it, including screening values, threshold values, 
                    acceptable concentrations, target values, intervention values, clean-up values, and 
                    many others (Beyer, 1990; Carlon et al., 2007; Jennings, 2013). For that reason, to carry out a 
                    global study on the actual state of soil pollution and to be able to make comparisons 
                    is extremely complex. However, this is one of the main challenges when making a 
                    regional or global assessment of soil pollution.
                    Agreement among scientists regarding concepts and definitions would help 
                    policy-makers and stakeholders to identify other strategies and techniques used in 
                    different parts of the world to assess and to address soil pollution. Using a common 
                    and a simplified language would also lead to better understanding of the issue of 
                    soil pollution.</p>

            <h3>1.2 | POINT-SOURCE AND DIFFUSE SOIL POLLUTION</h3>
            <p>Soil pollution, as has been said, can result from both intended and unintended
                activities. These activities can include the direct deposition of contaminants into
                the soil as well as complex environmental processes that can lead to indirect soil
                contamination through water or atmospheric deposition (Tarazona, 2014). In the
                following sections, the different types of soil pollution are described. </p>

            <h3>1.2.1 | POINT-SOURCE POLLUTION</h3>
            <p>Soil pollution can be caused by a specific event or a series of events within a
                particular area in which contaminants are released to the soil, and the source
                and identity of the pollution is easily identified. This type of pollution is known
                as point-source pollution. Anthropogenic activities represent the main sources
                of point-source pollution. Examples include former factory sites, inadequate
                waste and wastewater disposal, uncontrolled landfills, excessive application of
                agrochemicals, spills of many types, and many others. Activities such as mining
                and smelting that are carried out using poor environmental standards are also sources of contamination with heavy metals in many regions of the world (Lu et
                al., 2015; Mackay et al., 2013; Podolský et al., 2015; Strzebońska, Jarosz-Krzemińska and Adamiec, 2017).
                Other examples of point-source pollution are aromatic hydrocarbons and toxic
                metals, which are related to oil products. The sites range from leakage from tank
                installations in Greenland, which caused aromatic hydrocarbon and toxic metal
                levels that exceeded the Danish environmental quality criteria (Fritt-Rasmussen et al.,
                2012), to accidental leakage from oil refinery storage tanks in Tehran (Bayat et al., 2016).
                Point-source pollution is very common in urban areas. Soils near roads have high
                levels of heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other pollutants
                (Kim et al., 2017; Kumar and Kothiyal, 2016; Venuti, Alfonsi and Cavallo, 2016; Zhang et al., 2015b). Old
                or illegal landfills, where waste is not disposed of properly or according to its
                toxicity (e.g. batteries or radioactive waste), as well as disposal of sewage sludge and
                wastewater, can also be important point-source pollutants (Baderna et al., 2011; BaumanKaszubska and Sikorski, 2009; Swati et al., 2014). Finally, point-source pollution caused
                by industrial activities can pose risks to human health. For example, over 5 000
                brownfields in China are currently affecting the health of their inhabitants (Yang et
                al., 2014). Urban brownfields, located in urban centres, are sites that once harboured
                industrial activities that have since been relocated.</p>
                <h3>1.2.2 | DIFFUSE POLLUTION</h3>
                <p>Diffuse pollution is pollution that is spread over very wide areas, accumulates in
                    soil, and does not have a single or easily identified source. Diffuse pollution occurs
                    where emission, transformation and dilution of contaminants in other media have
                    occurred prior to their transfer to soil (FAO and ITPS, 2015). Diffuse pollution involves
                    the transport of pollutants via air-soil-water systems. Complex analyses involving
                    these three compartments is therefore needed in order adequately to assess this
                    type of pollution (Geissen et al., 2015). For that reason, diffuse pollution is difficult to
                    analyze, and it can be challenging to track and to delimit its spatial extent. Many of
                    the contaminants that cause local pollution may be involved in diffuse pollution,
                    since their fate in the environment is not well understood (Grathwohl and Halm, 2003).
                    Examples of diffuse pollution are numerous and can include sources from nuclear
                    power and weapons activities; uncontrolled waste disposal and contaminated
                    effluents released in and near catchments; land application of sewage sludge; the
                    agricultural use of pesticides and fertilizers which also add heavy metals, persistent
                    organic pollutants, excess nutrients and agrochemicals that are transported
                    downstream by surface runoff; flood events; atmospheric transport and deposition;
                    and/or soil erosion (Figure 2). Diffuse pollution has a significant impact on the
                    environment and human health, although its severity and extent are generally
                    unknown. 
                    It has been widely demonstrated that the upper layers of soil are enriched in many
                    metals and other elements that are linked to atmospheric deposition from natural
                    and anthropogenic sources (Blaser et al., 2000; Steinnes et al., 1997; Steinnes, Berg and Uggerud,
                    2011). Almost every soil of the northern hemisphere contains radionuclides in higher concentrations than the background level, even in remote areas of North America and Eastern Asia. Due to the nuclear fallout after the catastrophic Chernobyl
                    accident, radionuclides will be present in soils for centuries (Fesenko et al., 2007). More
                    than 50 years will be needed to reach a reduction of 50 percent of the radionuclides,
                    such as 239/240 Pu or 241Am, in areas up to 200 km away from Chernobyl.
                    Due to these different types of pollution from diverse sources, an increase in
                    scientific and technical efforts is needed to develop new methods for measuring,
                    monitoring and better understanding atmospheric deposition processes and the
                    extent of diffuse pollution.</p>

            <h3>1.3.0 | EFFECT OF SOIL POLLUTION</h2>
            <p>Soil pollution affects soil fertility; this jeopardises food security, which is essential for human survival. It also poses risks to human health — both indirectly through the consumption of contaminated food and drinking water, and directly through exposure to contaminated soil.

                Soils can become polluted in various ways. For example, repeated pesticide application is a significant issue because it lowers soil biodiversity and resilience, and could lead to the contamination of food and feed. The zero pollution action plan sets targets of a 50% reduction in the use of chemical pesticides and the risks they pose, and a 50% reduction in the use of more hazardous pesticides by 2030 (for more information, see the zero pollution production and consumption section). Excess nutrients are another source of soil pollution. They lead to ecosystem eutrophication and reduced biodiversity, and result from fertiliser and manure application or from the deposition of certain air pollutants. The zero pollution action plan sets a target to reduce nutrient losses related to excessive nutrient application by at least 50% by 2030 (for more information, see the zero pollution analysis on nutrient losses). Another target which will promote healthier soils requires a reduction of 25% in the area of land impacted by air pollution; this target is assessed in the air and ecosystems section.
                
                The EU soil strategy for 2030 reiterates the zero pollution target that, by 2050, soil pollution should be so low that it no longer harms human health (EC, 2021). The strategy prioritises preventing pollution at its source, which aligns with the zero pollution hierarchy. The soil strategy proposes a future soil health law; this is expected to include provisions on identifying, keeping an inventory of and remediating contaminated sites — significantly reducing risks as a result.

            <h2>Preventing Soil Pollution</h2>
            <p>The release of pollutants to the environment, as has been mentioned, usually
                originates from anthropogenic processes. Even if some elements and compounds
                occur naturally in soils, human interventions are the main drivers of soil pollution.
                The following sections discuss only a small subset of the most common pollutants
                affecting agricultural areas, and the properties that make these compounds
                pollutants. Pollutants have been divided by their chemical characteristics, but
                some of the categories presented here overlap. Swartjes proposed a systematic
                categorization of pollutants (Figure 5) that may be useful in better understanding
                them (Swartjes, 2011). </p>
                <img src="image.png" width="100%" height="500">
                <p>The term “heavy metals” refers to the group of metals and metalloids of relatively
                    high atomic mass (>4.5 g/cm3
                    ) such as Pb, Cd, Cu, Hg, Sn, and Zn, that can cause
                    toxicity problems. Other non-metals that are often considered together with
                    heavy metals include As, antimony (Sb) and selenium (Se) (Kemp, 1998). These
                    elements naturally occur at low concentrations in soils. Many of them are essential
                    micronutrients for plants, animals and humans, but at high concentrations may
                    cause phytotoxicity and harm human health because of their non-biodegradable
                    nature, which causes them to readily accumulate in tissues and living organisms.
                    The main anthropogenic sources of heavy metals are industrial areas, mine
                    tailings, disposal of high metal wastes, leaded gasoline and paints, application of
                    fertilizers, animal manures, sewage sludge, pesticides, wastewater irrigation, coal
                    combustion residues, spillage of petrochemicals, and atmospheric deposition from
                    varied sources (Alloway, 2013).
                    Heavy metals are the most persistent and complex kind of pollutants to remediate
                    in nature. They not only degrade the quality of the atmosphere, water bodies, and
                    food crops, but also threaten the health and well-being of animals and human
                    beings. Metals accumulate in the tissues of living organisms because unlike most
                    organic compounds they are not subject to metabolic breakdown. Among the
                    heavy metals, Zn, Ni, Co, and Cu are relatively more toxic to plants, and As, Cd, Pb,
                    Cr and Hg are relatively more toxic to higher animals (McBride, 1994).
                    The most important elements to consider in terms of food-chain contamination are
                    As, Cd, Hg, Pb and Se (McLaughlin, Parker and Clarke, 1999). The main sources of As in soils
                    are agrochemical compounds and mining and smelting activities, but they can also
                    be introduced in manure originating from livestock feed with As-rich additives.
                    Some parent materials are rich in As and therefore their weathering can also be a
                    source of As in high concentrations.
                    Trace metals from inorganic (Cu-based) and organic pesticides represent a major
                    environmental and toxicological concern (Komárek et al., 2010). Cu is easily immobilized
                    by soil organic matter (SOM) and Fe- and Mn-(hydro)oxides, remaining at high
                    concentrations on upper layers of soils. However, fungicide-derived Cu has been
                    found in large amounts in the potentially available fraction of the soil (Pietrzak and
                    McPhail, 2004).
